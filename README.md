# REACT-ARIA

Most of the codes were based from [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)
](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/).

This personal repository describes how to apply accessibility semantics to common design patterns and widgets. It provides design patterns and functional examples.

Since most of the examples were written in Vanilla JS, this is my attempt to implement them in React and Typescript.
